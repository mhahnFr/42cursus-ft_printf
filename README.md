# Welcome to 42cursus-ft_printf!
This project is an exercise of the [42 school](https://www.github.com/42-Heilbronn). The task is to recode the basics of the libc ``printf`` function. As a bonus, one can recode some flags as well as the width and the precision. The projects subject is to teach how variadic functions work in C, but also to teach how to organize bigger projects.

## Purpose of this repository
This repository shows my solutions of this exercise, although I have not done the bonus 
part.

## Usage
If you wish to use this library, simply include the ``ft_printf.h`` header and use its ``Makefile``.
