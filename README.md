# Welcome to 42cursus-ft_printf!
This project is an exercise of the [42 school](https://www.github.com/42-Heilbronn). The task is to recode the basics of the libc ``printf`` function. As a bonus, one can recode some flags as well as the width and the precision. The projects subject is to teach how variadic functions work in C, but also to teach how to organize bigger projects.

## Purpose of this repository
This repository shows my solutions of this exercise, although I have not done the bonus part.

### Approach
I used the ``ModelViewController`` principle for this project. The printing part represents the View, the formatting part follows the model part of the principle. I have not done the bonus part, it could be added quite easy though. Apart from the ``MVC`` principle, I used an object-orientied style.

## Usage
If you wish to use this library, simply include the ``ft_printf.h`` header and use its ``Makefile``.
